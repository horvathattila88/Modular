Modular synth stuff

Most of these are designs from other people, i've just redrawn them to fit into a eurorack system. The PCB's are smaller than 100x100mm, so it's easier to have them manufactured, pick any of your favourite manufacturers. The plans are in EAGLE 7.4 format, you can generate gerbers from there, according to the manufacturers needs. 
I have uploaded this for hobbyists, i don't make any money out of it, you shouldn't sell the boards! 
The MFOS ones are designed by Ray Wilson - Music From Outer Space, please respect his heritage. 
Yusynth is Yves Usson

Here is the status of the modules:
